# CAVE

Future home of Unity + MiddleVR project needed to build VR projects in the CAVE.

## Using the CAVE

### Startup

1) Launch the Motive and MiddleVR applications
2) Turn on all 7 projectors (`STARTUP.bat` on the desktop)
3) Turn on glasses (front button by left temple)
   - Shutter will darken the left and right eye then turn on
Turn on controller (center button)
   - Light 1 will be solid blue

### Shutdown

1) Close the open windows
2) Turn off all 7 projectors (`SHUTDOWN.bat` on the desktop)
3) Turn off the glasses (press and hold)
4) Turn off the controller

## Troubleshooting the CAVE

### No stereoscopy

The sync card (back of PC, at the top) will flash several yellow lights when in sync. In addition, the RF device (behind stereo receiver) will flash twice in quick succession, pause, then flash twice, etc. If this is not happening the stereoscopy sync definitely isn't working.

- Note that stereoscopy will not work if "Remote Desktop Connection" is enabled.

### Eyes out of sync

Controller not connected
The USB dongle for the controller is connected to the front of the PC. A simple unplug and re-plug should do the trick.

### MiddleVR License
